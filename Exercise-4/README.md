Exercise 4
Here is some CSS:

html {
  font-size: 100%;
}

div {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
Based on the provided styles, program a new CSS selector that adds 32px of padding to the all four sides of every div element that has a class equal to either intro or sidebar. Your padding value should be expressed in rem units, not pixels, and should be done using shorthand notation.
