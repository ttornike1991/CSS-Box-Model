Exercise 6
Program a CSS selector with the following declarations:

element being selected is a section
element being selected class should be equal to intro
text color should be hexcode ffc700
element background color should be hexcode 18354a
text font size should be equivalent to 18px
element should have a 32px margin on the top and bottom
element should be horizontally centered
element should have 48px of padding on all four sides
element should have a solid, 1px border that is light gray
element should be as wide as possible, but no wider than 900px
element should be as high/tall as necessary based on the content within
all size/dimension values should be coded in rem units (assume root element font-size: 100%), EXCEPT the border width which should be expressed as 1px
Note: write all of your selectors in alphabetical order, use shorthand notation wherever possible, and round all values to the nearest hundredth.
