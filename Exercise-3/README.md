Exercise 3
Here is some CSS:

html {
  font-size: 100%;
}

div {
  font-size: 1rem;
}
Based on the provided styles, program a new CSS selector that adds a 48px margin to the top and bottom of every div element, BUT your margin value should be expressed in rem units, not pixels, and should be done using shorthand notation.
